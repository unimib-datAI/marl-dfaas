# Multi-Agent RL for DFaaS by Emanuele Petriglia

This repository is in a **working in progress** state.

If you are looking for the source code of the experiments of Emanuele
Petriglia's master's thesis, discussed in October 2024, see the
[`petriglia-thesis-2024`](https://github.com/unimib-datAI/marl-dfaas/tree/petriglia-thesis-2024)
branch.

The thesis, a summary and the presentation slides are available in another
[repository hosted on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ema-pe/master-degree-thesis),
but they are written in Italian.

## Project directory structure

* `configs`: contains the specific configuration for the environment, models and
  other aspects of the experiments.
* `dataset`: contains the dataset used to have real function invocations traces
  in the DFaaS environment (instead of generated ones).
* `notebooks`: Python Jupyter notebooks used mainly to show plots of the
  experiments and do some simple prototyping or experiments.
* `patches`: required custom patches to Ray RLlib or other libraries needed to
  run the experiments.
* `plots`: non-interactive Python scripts to generate plots from experiments.
* `results`: default directory where the experiment data is stored. This folder
  is not shown in the repository because it contains ephemeral data.
* `tests`: some Python scripts used to test the Ray RLLib, the DFaaS
  environment, or other miscellaneous tests.

## How to set up the environment

The experiments are run and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 using Python 3.12. For a
reproducible development environment, it is preferable to install the
dependencies in a virtual environment (see the
[`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/venv.html) module). The `venv`
module is not installed by default in Ubuntu, it must be installed using `sudo
apt install python3.12-venv`.

To run the experiments, the main dependencies are:

* [Ray RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-2.40.0/rllib/):
  this is a reinforcement learning library used to define the DFaaS custom
  environment, run the experiments by training the models with the implemented
  algorithms. The version is pinned to 2.40.0.

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.5/): is a library for deep learning on
  GPUs and CPUs. It is used by Ray RLlib when training models with deep learning
  reinforcement learning algorithms.

* [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/): is a JSON library that is faster
  than the standard library. Used because the experiments generate large JSON
  files that slow down the encoding/decoding processes.

* [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/): a small module that enriches the log
  output during the train.

When you install these dependenceis using `pip`, it automatically installs other
dependencies, some of them are directly used by the project (like NumPy,
Gymnasium, Pandas or NetworkX).

The following dependencies are required for plotting or running notebooks:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): is a plot generation library used in
  the scripts in the [`plots`](plots) and [`notebooks`](notebooks) directory.

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/v7.3.2/):
  Jupyter notebooks are used to create plots and explore results and statistics
  from the experiments. The notebooks are stored in the `notebooks` directory. 

* [ipympl](https://matplotlib.org/ipympl/): this is an extension for Jupyter
  Notebook to support interactive Matplotlib using Jupyter Widgets
  [`ipywidgets`](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).

* [nbstripout](https://pypi.org/project/nbstripout/): utility that erases a
  Jupyter Notebook's output before committing to git.

Note that scripts in the `plots` directory are not interactive and only require
Matplotlib.

There are two requirements files for `pip` in the repository:

* [`requirements.base.txt`](requirements.base.txt): contains only the
  dependencies listed above with fixed versions,
* [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt): contains the full list of dependencies
  with fixed versions.

Run the following commands to set up the development environment with Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt install python3.12-venv
$ git clone https://github.com/unimib-datAI/marl-dfaas.git
$ cd marl-dfaas
$ python3.12 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install --requirement requirements.base.txt
```

Or, for a perfect reproducibility:

    $ pip install --requirement requirements.txt

Please note that the requirements file expects a machine with an NVIDIA GPU and
CUDA (at least 12.4) installed for PyTorch. PyTorch can also be used with a CPU,
in this case follow the [instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
on the official website.

The [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) also contains some development tools:

* [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io): a source code formatted for Python
  code and Jupyter notebooks,
* [`pylint`](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): a static code
  analyser,
* [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com): to run hooks when doing a Git commit,
* [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout): to clean the output of
  notebooks before committing them.

## How to run the experiments

**Important**: always run Python scripts from the project root directory to
allow loading of commonly used modules (`dfaas_env.py`...). As example, if you
need to run a test script:

    $ python tests/env/local_strategy.py

### Training

Run the [`dfaas_train.py`](dfaas_train.py) Python script. (**WIP**)

### Evaluation

Run the [`dfaas_evaluate.py`](dfaas_evaluate_ppo.py) Python script. (**WIP**)

### How to run Jupyter notebooks

Just run:

    $ jupyter notebook --config jupyter_notebook_config.py

Then open http://localhost:8888/tree in a Web browser.

## Patching Ray

The selected version of Ray RLlib needs to be patched to fix some bugs or
undesirable behaviour that has not yet been addressed upstream. The patches are
collected in the [`patches`](patches) directory and can be applied using the
[`patch`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/patch.1.html) command:

    patch -p0 < patches/NAME.patch

The patches have only been tested with Ray 2.40.0. They will only work if the
virtual environment is named `.env` and the Python version is 3.12, as the file
path is hardcoded into the patch file.

Note: The `patch` binary is required and preinstalled on Ubuntu. If not
available, it can be installed with `apt install patch`.

The patches are created using the standard
[`diff`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html) tool:

    diff -Naru .env/.../rllib/example.py .env/.../rllib/example_new.py > patches/NAME.patch
